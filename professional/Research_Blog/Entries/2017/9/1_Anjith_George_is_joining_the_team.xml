He has developed algorithms for low-cost eye gaze tracking in desktop as well as wearable scenarios. He has proposed and implemented a novel eye movement based biometrics identification algorithm. In his master's work, he has developed algorithms for driver drowsiness detection in automotive environments.&#xD;&#xD;His current research interests include Computer vision,&#xA0; deep learning, biometrics, and image processing. He is gearing up to work on secured face recognition where spoofing attacks can be preemptively addressed.&#xD;</richText>
