For his master thesis &#x201C;Development of techniques for system with palm biometric feature extraction facilities&#x201D; he developed palm&#x2019;s vein and crease detection filters for a bi-modal biometric system. It was done while working at Institute of Electronics and Computer Science. There he worked in Digital Signal Processing Lab since 2011 as electronics engineer and researcher. Teodors mainly worked on the algorithm development for the palm biometric system and their implementation on FPGA. His research interests are in the area of palm biometrics, digital signal and image processing, embedded system design. Currently Teodors is working on his PhD thesis.</richText>
