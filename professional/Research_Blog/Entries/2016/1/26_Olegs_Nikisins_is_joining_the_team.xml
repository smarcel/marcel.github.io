His primary research and development experience is related to Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques with application to biometrics (&lt;a href="http://bite.edi.lv"&gt;http://bite.edi.lv&lt;/a&gt;/) (face recognition, multi-modal biometrics, recognition of palm veins and ridges), medical imaging and other industry oriented tasks. &#xD;After receiving a PhD Olegs carried out a research in Aalborg University (AAU, Denmark) in the field of multi-modal face recognition. In AAU he collected a database of synchronized RGB, 3D and Thermal facial images and designed a three-modal face recognition system / algorithm. &#xD;Besides biometric-related research Olegs participated in various Computer Vision based projects: segmentation of blood vessels in medical scans of the lungs, recognition of traffic signs, real time recognition of playing cards, design of control system for manufacturing of electronic components.</richText>
