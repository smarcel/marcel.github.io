    <richText>I was invited to speak at the FRONTEX ABC Conference (Warsaw ) on Oct 11 2013 during the debate session &#x2028;&#x201C;&lt;b&gt;Why are risk management and vulnerability assessment important?&lt;/b&gt;&#x201D;.&#xD;&#xD;The session was moderated by Ted Dunstone (Chair of the Technical Committee, Biometrics Institute, Australia) and aimed to raise awareness about the importance of vulnerability assessment and testing as well as about the benefits of information sharing, albeit the high sensitivity of this subject matter. The main vulnerabilities of ABC systems and their known strengths and weaknesses both at the technical and the operational levels were discussed. The session explored how to mitigate existing shortcomings to enhance the systems&#x2019; robustness.&#xD;&#xD;Other speakers:&#xD;	&#x2022;	 Hans de Moel (Policy Officer, Royal Netherlands Marechaussee, The Netherlands)&#xD;	&#x2022;	 James Lipsett (Senior Analyst, Risk Analysis Unit, Frontex)&#xD;	&#x2022;	 Olivier Touret (Market Manager, Morpho, France)&#xD;	&#x2022;	 G&#xFC;nter Schumacher (Principal Researcher, Joint Research Centre, JRC, European Commission)&#xD;&#xD;</richText>
