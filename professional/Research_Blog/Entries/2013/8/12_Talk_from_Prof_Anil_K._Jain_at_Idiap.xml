    <richText>On September 3 2013 at 2pm, Idiap will have the honor to welcome Prof Anil K. Jain that will give a talk entitled:&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Biometric Recognition: &#x2028;Sketch to photo matching, Tattoo Matching and Fingerprint Obfuscation&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;If you are like many people, navigating the complexities of everyday life depends on an array of cards and passwords that confirm your identity. But lose a card, and your ATM will refuse to give you money. Forget a password, and your own computer may balk at your command. Allow your card or passwords to fall into the wrong hands, and what were intended to be security measures can become the tools of fraud or identity theft. Biometrics&#x2014;the automated recognition of people via distinctive anatomical and behavioral traits&#x2014;has the potential to overcome many of these problems. &#xD;Biometrics is not a new idea. Pioneering work by several British scholars, including Fauld, Galton and Henry in the late 19th century established that fingerprints exhibit a unique pattern that persists over time. This set the stage for the development of Automatic Fingerprint Identification Systems that are now used by law enforcement agencies worldwide. The success of fingerprints in law enforcement coupled with growing concerns related to homeland security, financial fraud and identity theft has generated renewed interest in research and development of biometric systems. It is, therefore, not surprising to see biometrics permeating our society (laptops and mobile phones, border crossing, civil registration, and access to secure facilities). Despite these successful deployments, biometrics is not a panacea for human recognition. There are challenges related to data acquisition, image quality, robust matching, multibiometrics, biometric system security and user privacy. This talk will introduce three challenging problems of particular interest to law enforcement and border crossing agencies: (i) face sketch to photo matching, (ii) scars, marks &amp; tattoos (SMT) and (iii) fingerprint obfuscation. &#xD;&#xD;Anil K.

Jain is a University Distinguished Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Michigan State University where he conducts research in pattern recognition, computer vision and biometrics. He has received Guggenheim fellowship, Humboldt Research award, Fulbright fellowship, IEEE Computer Society Technical Achievement award, W. Wallace McDowell award, IAPR King-Sun Fu Prize, and ICDM Research Award for contributions to pattern recognition and biometrics. He served as the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Trans. Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence and is a Fellow of ACM, IEEE, AAAS, IAPR and SPIE. &#xA0;Holder of eight patents in biometrics, he is the author of several books. ISI has designated him as a highly cited author. He served as a member of the National Academies panels on Information Technology, Whither Biometrics and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED). He also served as a member of the Defense Science Board.&#xD;&#xD;His H-index is 137 (Source: &lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g-_ZXGsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt;).&#xD;&#xD;</richText>
