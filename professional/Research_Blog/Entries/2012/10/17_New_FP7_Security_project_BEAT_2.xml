    <richText>I am glad to announce the setup of BEAT subgroup for Common Criteria (CC) evaluations of biometric systems. This subgroup is composed of the core BEAT partners as well as &#xD;the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) - DE,&#xD;the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) - UK,&#xD;the Agence Nationale de la S&#xE9;curit&#xE9; des Syst&#xE8;mes d&#x2019;Information (ANSSI) - FR,&#xD;the National Cryptologic Center (CCN) - ES,&#xD;the Biometrics Institute (BI) - AU,&#xD;and the European Association for Biometrics (EAB).&#xD;&#xD;The first meeting of the BEAT subgroup for Common Criteria (CC) evaluations of biometric systems was held on Oct 17 2012 in Essen (DE). The chairman of the subgroup is Alain Merle from CEA (FR).&#xD;&#xD;The Biometrics Evaluation and Testing (BEAT) project funded by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) with S&#xE9;bastien Marcel as the Principal Investigator and Project Coordinator at the Idiap research institute.&#xD;&#xD;About BEAT:&#xD;The goal of BEAT is to propose a framework of standard operational evaluations for biometric technologies. This will be achieved by (1) developing an online and open platform to transparently and independently evaluate biometric systems against validated benchmarks, (2) designing protocols and tools for vulnerability analysis, and (3) developing standardization documents for Common Criteria evaluations. Additionally, legal aspects will be considered to address the issues of both privacy data protection and Intellectual Property and so ensure that the BEAT framework can be used by the research community and companies. There will be three outcomes of this project. The first is that the reliability of biometric systems will be measurable and thus should lead to a meaningful increase in performance. The second is that technology transfer from research to companies will be much easier as there will be an interoperable framework. Finally, decision-makers and authorities will be informed about the progress that is made in biometrics as the results will have an impact on standards. Given these outcomes we expect that BEAT will significantly contribute to the development of a European Identification Certification System.&#xD;&#xD;Project website: &lt;a href="http://www.beat-eu.org"&gt;http://www.beat-eu.org&lt;/a&gt;/ &#xD;</richText>
