    <richText>Val&#xE9;rie is leaving Idiap. Although she was not part of the research team, strictly speaking, as she was one of our program manager at Idiap, I think she deserved an entry in this blog as an acknowledgement. Indeed, over these 4 years she performed a remarkable work and was a great support during both the preparation and running of our projects (MOBIO, TABULA RASA and more recently BEAT).&#xD;&#xD;Val&#xE9;rie thank you again for all that. We will miss your dynamism. All the best and see you soon.</richText>
