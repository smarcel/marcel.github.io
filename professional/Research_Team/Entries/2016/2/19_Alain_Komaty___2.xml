    <richText>Member of the biometric team from May 2016 to --.&#xD;PostDoc on automatic speaker recognition.&#xD;Involved in the project ODESSA.&#xD;&#xD;Ali Komaty received his PhD from the French Naval Academy Research Institute (IRENav), in Brest, France in 2014. His primary research where on statistical signal processing, where he studied the performances and limits of the Empirical Mode Decomposition when facing correlated noise (fractional Gaussian noise) and impulsive noise (alpha-stable noise). During his PhD, he has established research collaborations with the American University of Washington and FEMTO-ST Besan&#xE7;on, France.&#xD;After receiving his PhD, he worked with the passive acoustics (AP) department of the ENSTA Bretagne, Brest, France as a postdoctoral researcher. His research focused on inverse problems, more precisely on whales depth and range estimation using only one hydrophone, where he used modal propagation theory, time-frequency warping and filtering to achieve depth discrimination. His work was on collaboration with the university of California at San Diego.&#xD;</richText>
