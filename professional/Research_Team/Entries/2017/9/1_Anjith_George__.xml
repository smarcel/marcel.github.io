    <richText>Member of the biometric team from October 2017 to ---.&#xD;&#xD;PostDoc on secured face recognition (ie. face presentation attack detection).&#xD;Involved in the project IARPA ODIN BATL.&#xD;&#xD;Anjith&#xA0; George is currently pursuing Ph.D. from a Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur, India.&#xA0; His thesis work focuses on image-based eye gaze tracking and its applications such as biometric identification and activity recognition. He has developed algorithms for low-cost eye gaze tracking in desktop as well as wearable scenarios. He has proposed and implemented a novel eye movement based biometrics identification algorithm. In his master's work, he has developed algorithms for driver drowsiness detection in automotive environments.&#xD;&#xD;His current research interests include Computer vision,&#xA0; deep learning, biometrics, and image processing. He is gearing up to work on secured face recognition where spoofing attacks can be preemptively addressed.</richText>
